# Difference between interfaces and abstract classes

## Interfaces

* Sets up a contract between different classes
* Use when we have very different objects we want to have work together
* Promotes loose coupling

## Inheritance/Abstract classes

* Sets up a contract between different classes
* Use when we are trying to build up a definition of an object
* Strongly couples classes together
